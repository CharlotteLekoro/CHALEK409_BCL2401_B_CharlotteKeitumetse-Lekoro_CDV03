Challenges I had with this resume was because i really have nothing to put into the resume, even looking up online for entry level resume examples i found mostly people who have university degrees and there isnt much on people doing the same route that we are doing, it  would have been nice to have an example that shows someone who is doing it the way we are doing it so that we can see the type of wording they used in the resume. 
I have no done any extra certificates and have only been doing this for three months now so it was very difficult to make a resume on just software development especially with out the formal studying of a degree a least then you have some things to include beside the HTML and CSS and now JAVASCRIPT. 
I do know that this is also a work in progress so I can still update it as we keep leaning new things so as time goes on there should be more things I can still add on to it.
